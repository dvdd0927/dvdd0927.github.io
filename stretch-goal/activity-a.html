		<h3>PREAMBLE</h3>

		<!-- Content of PREAMBLE -->
		<!-- First Paragraph -->

			The clauses that are included in the full version give examples and details of how 
			these aspirations change the way we act as a software engineering professionals.
			Without the aspirations, the details can become legalistic and tedious; without the 
			details, the aspirations can become high-sounding but empty; together, the aspirations 
			and the details from a cohesive code.
		</p>

		<!-- Second Paragraph -->
